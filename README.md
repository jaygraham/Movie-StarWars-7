<title>Star Wars 7 Review</title>
<h1><b><cite>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</cite> Review</h1>
<hr>
<p>Having seen the seventh edition in the Star Wars saga I have decided to write my review of what can only be described as a Disney-sized disaster. Like anything from Disney it costs $15, was initially good, but left an unsatisfyingly cheap taste to my mouth. speaking of worthless things, this website is dedicated to one little brother who blessed this underwhelming movie by not filling up the gas tank after using my car. So without further ado...
<h3><cite>Star Wars, The Force <s>Awakens</s></cite> needs an extra 5 minutes.</h3>
<p> <img src="Desktop/Poster2.jpg" alt="Vader Then and Now" title="Darth Vader, like the Star wars series has not aged well since their inception" /> Opening on a deserted and barren place, in a time that is both long ago (and a place far away), the Star Wars franchise begins. Like Disney the galaxy is ruled by power hungry usurpers of a once righteous and powerful dynasty. And so begins the review. My initial thoughts were one of child who just entered a wave pool at a local water park, though to my dismay, I further begin to learn that the neck high waters of fun turn into a river of urine. The picture above is both a clip of the new movie and a real-time image of the disintegrating spirit of Star Wars.  </p>


<h3> Why it sucks Eggs </h3>
<ul>
 <li> The series has become highly franchised with it's purchase by Disney studios.</li>
 <li> If Disney tried to focus on anything it was marketing to teens and diversity quotas over the plot ands style of it's predecessors. </li>
 <li> Kalu-rin (a hardened member of the Sith) is still facing the same daddy issues all the other Sith faced as opposed to an more diverse and active motivational device. </li>
 <li> BB-8 is more machine than lovable character, which diminishes of one's connection to man and machine.</li>
 <li> Referring to older star wars movies seemed to be 60% of the purpose of this story, which makes one focus less on a proper development of plot. What happens now is the oppotunity for fans to circle-jerk over a nostalgia most never got the chance to experience. For fans fromthe beginning they know that this type of movie is a flat out sell out. </li>
